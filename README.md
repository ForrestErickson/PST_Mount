# Mount for Personal Solar Telescope
**WARNING NEVER LOOK AT THE SUN THROUGH A TELESCOPE, BINOCULARS, NAKED EYE, unless you have a known safe solar filter and you know how to use it.**  
Never make a home made filter out of unknown materials.  
Galellio was blind at the end of his life. I do not know how he observed sun spots but he did. And he went blind.

Several friends in the Smoky Mountain Astronomical Society, aka **[SMAS](https://groups.io/g/smokymtnastro)**, have the Coronado PST.   
I am hoping to help make them easier to use.
